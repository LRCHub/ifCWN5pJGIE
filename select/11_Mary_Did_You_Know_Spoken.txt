Mary did you know that your baby boy
Would one day walk on water
Mary did you know that your baby boy
Would save our sons and daughters

Did you know that your baby boy
Has come to make you new
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you

Mary did you know that your baby boy
Would give sight to a blind man
Mary did you know that your baby boy
Would calm a storm with his hands

Did you know that your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod
When you kiss your baby
You kiss the face of God

The blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The tongue will speak
The praises of the Lamb

Mary did you know that your baby boy
Is Lord of all Creation
Mary did you know that your baby boy
Would one day rule the nations

Did you know that your baby boy
Is Heaven's perfect Lamb
And this little child you're holding
Is the great I Am
