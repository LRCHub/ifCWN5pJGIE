Mary, did you know, your Baby Boy
Would one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know, your Baby Boy
Will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know, your Baby Boy
Has come to make you new?
This Child that you delivered
Will soon deliver you
Mary, did you know, your Baby Boy
Will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
Will calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know that your Baby Boy
Has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss, your little Baby
You've kissed the face of God?
Mary, did you know?
The blind will see, the deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb
Mary, did you know, your Baby Boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Did you know, your Baby Boy
Will one day rule the nations?
Did you know that your Baby Boy
Is heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping Child you're holding
Is the Great, I Am
Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know that your Baby Boy
Has come to make you new?
And that this Child you've delivered
Will soon deliver you
Mary, did you know?
Did you know that your Baby Boy
Has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss, your little Baby
You've kissed the face of God?
Mary, did you know?
